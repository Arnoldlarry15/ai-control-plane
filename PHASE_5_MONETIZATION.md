# Phase 5: Monetization — The Salesforce Playbook

## Goal

**Print money without selling models.**

AI Control Plane is not an AI model provider. We don't compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. We sit above, between, and across all of them as the **mandatory governance layer**.

This is the Salesforce playbook: charge for value, not cost. Open core, paid enterprise control. Clean. Proven. Scalable.

---

## Pricing Axes

The key to monetization is **multiple pricing axes**. Don't charge one way—charge every way that delivers value.

### 1. Per AI Request Governed

**The Core Metric: Every Governed Request**

- Every AI execution flows through the control plane
- Metered at the gateway level
- Volume pricing: Higher usage = better rates
- Transparent billing: See exactly what you're paying for

**Pricing:**
- Open Source: Free up to 10,000 requests/month
- Starter: $0.001 per request (overage)
- Professional: $0.0005 per request
- Enterprise: $0.0002 per request (volume discount)

**Why it works:** This is pure value. Every request is governed, audited, and compliant. That's worth paying for.

### 2. Per Policy Pack

**Packaged Governance Logic**

Policy packs are pre-built, tested governance bundles:
- **Basic Pack**: Core policies (included in all paid tiers)
- **Security Pack**: Advanced security policies
- **Cost Control Pack**: Budget and spending controls
- **Compliance Pack**: Regulatory compliance helpers
- **Custom Packs**: Industry-specific or customer-specific

**Pricing:**
- Starter: 2 included, $49/month per additional pack
- Professional: 4 included, $99/month per additional pack
- Enterprise: All included

**Why it works:** Packs are proven, tested, and deliver immediate value. Buying a pack is cheaper than building yourself.

### 3. Per Compliance Module

**Regulatory Compliance as a Service**

Each compliance module is a complete, production-ready implementation:
- **GDPR**: EU data protection
- **HIPAA**: US healthcare privacy
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment card security
- **NIST AI RMF**: AI risk management
- **EU AI Act**: Emerging AI regulation

**Pricing:**
- Open Source: None included
- Starter: 1 included (GDPR), $99/month per additional
- Professional: 3 included, $199/month per additional
- Enterprise: All included

**Why it works:** Compliance is expensive and risky. Having a pre-built, tested module is worth significant money.

### 4. Per Organization / Per Seat

**Team-Based Pricing**

- **Base per-org fee**: Platform access and infrastructure
- **Per-seat pricing**: For user access and collaboration

**Pricing:**
- Open Source: 3 seats max
- Starter: 10 seats included, $29/month per additional seat
- Professional: 50 seats included, $49/month per additional seat
- Enterprise: Unlimited seats, $99/month per seat (volume)

**Why it works:** Classic SaaS pricing. Proven model that scales with team size.

### 5. Audit & Reporting Tiers

**Data Retention and Reporting**

Different tiers for different compliance needs:

| Tier | Retention | Features | Price |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Basic** | 7 days | Basic audit logs | Free |
| **Standard** | 30 days | Advanced reports | +$99/month |
| **Premium** | 90 days | Custom reports, exports | +$299/month |
| **Enterprise** | 1 year+ | Unlimited, compliance exports | +$999/month |

**Why it works:** Long retention is legally required for many industries. Charge for the compliance value.

**"We don't need governance yet"**
- Response: "When will you need it? After an incident? After a lawsuit? After a regulatory fine?"

**"Too expensive"**
- Response: "Compare to the cost of one GDPR fine (up to 4% of global revenue). We're insurance."

**"We'll use open source"**
- Response: "Great! That's us. When you need compliance modules or enterprise support, we're here."

## Implementation

### Metering & Billing

**Usage tracking:**
```python
# Every governed request is metered
metering_service.record_request(
    organization_id="acme-corp",
    agent_id="customer-bot",
    execution_id="exec-123",
    unit_price=0.0005  # Professional tier
)

# Policy pack usage
metering_service.record_policy_pack_usage(
    organization_id="acme-corp",
    policy_pack_id="security-pack",
    execution_id="exec-123"
)

# Compliance validation
metering_service.record_compliance_validation(
    organization_id="acme-corp",
    compliance_module="hipaa",
    execution_id="exec-123"
)
```

**Monthly billing calculation:**
```python
# Get usage metrics
metrics = metering_service.get_usage_metrics(
    organization_id="acme-corp",
    period_start=start_of_month,
    period_end=end_of_month
)

# Calculate cost
cost = pricing_service.calculate_monthly_cost(
    tier=LicenseType.PROFESSIONAL,
    requests=metrics.total_requests,
    seats=metrics.active_seats,
    additional_policy_packs=len(metrics.active_policy_packs) - 4,
    additional_compliance_modules=len(metrics.active_compliance_modules) - 3
)

# Total: base + overages + add-ons
total = cost["total"]  # Ready for invoice
```

### License Enforcement

**Feature gating:**
```python
# Check if customer can use SSO
license_key = license_manager.get_license_by_org(org_id)
has_access, reason = license_manager.check_feature_access(
    license_key.key,
    "sso"
)

if not has_access:
    raise UpgradeRequiredError(
        f"SSO requires Professional tier or higher. {reason}"
    )
```

**Usage limits:**
```python
# Check if within request limit
within_limit, reason = license_manager.check_limit(
    license_key.key,
    "max_requests_per_month",
    current_request_count
)

if not within_limit:
    # Either block or charge overage
    if tier == LicenseType.ENTERPRISE:
        # Enterprise: charge overage
        pass
    else:
        # Non-enterprise: hit limit, prompt upgrade
        raise UsageLimitError(reason)
```
